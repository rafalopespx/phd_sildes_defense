## Summary

This presentation is divided into 4 main parts:

+ Historical background on dengue

---

## Research questions

The thesis has two main underlying questions:

* In the Ecological part: **How temperature and precipitation affects the variability of dengue cases in a major city of Brazil?** The study covers 10 years (2010 - 2019) of dengue incidence

* In the Epidemiological part: **How temperature is associated with higher levels of dengue hospitalizations in Brazil?**
The study covers 10 years (2010 - 2019) of dengue hospitalization incidence

# Historical background

---

## Historical background

Dengue has been a major problem in Brazil throughout the 20th Century:

- First records of dengue in Brazil starts on the last decades of the 19th century

- The main vector of dengue, _Aedes Aegypti_ got locally eliminated, but was reintroduced in the 1970s

- Since then, dengue has continuously risen in incidence and dispersion over the Brazillian territory

- Since 2001, a dedicated system of notification and surveillance to the disease was built

---

## Dengue disease

.pull-left[

Dengue has the following characteristic:

- vector borne disease, human-mosquito-human cycle

- incubation period of four- to six-day and persists until around the time fever abates, 
which is typically three to seven days, potential of cryptic transmissions

- endemic disease in Brazil, with anual cycles of outbreaks

## Data sources:


.pull-left[

__Epidemiological data sources__

- _Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação_ (__SINAN__), system more prompt to notify symptomatic mild cases of dengue

- _Sistema de Informação Hospitalares_ (__SIH__), system more prompt to notify severe cases of dengue


]

.pull-right[

__Climate data sources__

- For the climate variables, we used the gridded daily ECVs taken from reanalysis products (__ERA5-Land__) 

- From the raw ECVs were produced weighted mean area aggregations over the municipalities (health regions, states, etc.) 
extent area, to create matching time series for each aggregation level

]


---

## Characteristics of dataset

The SINAN-Dengue has:

- ~11.0 million of individual cases confirmed for dengue, with information of Sex, Age, Municipality of Residence, from 2001 to 2020

- Sparse data before 2000, due to non obligatory notification, more consistent data after 2001

- With the majority of cases in the Southeast region and Northeast regions, ~5.7 millions and ~2.2 million cases, respectively

---

## Characteristics of dengue epidemics

The time-series of cases shows:

- Strong seasonality, right after the rainy season, relation to mosquito life cycle

- endemicity, endemic of annual outbreaks  of four different serotypes

- More recently, since 2020, has been raising on incidence and spread to the South region
